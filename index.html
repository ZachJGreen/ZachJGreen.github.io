            <p>As a child, I had a curiosity for how computers worked. I would often pass the time typing commands in the windows command prompt during my elementary school computer lab classes. No one ever expected an 11 year old to find interest in the blinking black box, so I got away with pranking my friends by shutting down their PCs remotely with a pop-up window saying they were "Banned from using computers forever! &#128545;"</p>
            <p>I didn't have my own PC at home until I was 17 years old. At the same time, I took a Junior level course in High School about Computer Programming in Java. This opened my eyes to coding for the first time. Of course, I've heard of it before on TV shows. Nerdy guys sitting at their desks hacking into the Pentagon to get details about some super bad guy, but I never really <i>experienced</i> programming like I did in that class.</p>\
            <p>Now that I'm enrolled in university I've begun to see just how much there is to learn about Computer Science and I'm completely here for it.</p>

            <p>When I first came to UMKC, I began to look for clubs and activities to meet new people. I'm not originally from Kansas City, so I felt it was important to find friends so that I would not be discouraged from being lonely. I quickly found the UMKC Esports Club. I joined the School's Valorant Junior Varsity team and learned more than I ever would have guessed from my time on the team. I learned that I love doing things that involve teamwork. There's nothing quite like seeing your team overcome an adversity by working together like a well oiled machine.</p>
