            <h3 class="box-header">Background</h3>
            <p>As a child, I had a curiosity for how computers worked. I would often pass the time typing commands in the windows command prompt during my elementary school computer lab classes. No one ever expected an 11 year old to find interest in the blinking black box, so I got away with pranking my friends by shutting down their PCs remotely with a pop-up window saying they were "Banned from using computers forever! &#128545;". While the school's security has definitely updated since way back when, I still look back at that memory fondly.</p>
            <p>I didn't have my own PC at home until I was 17 years old. At the same time, I took a Junior level course in High School about Computer Programming in Java. This opened my eyes to coding for the first time. Of course, I've heard of it before on TV shows. Nerdy guys sitting at their desks hacking into the Pentagon to get details about some super bad guy, but I never really <i>experienced</i> programming like I did in that class.</p>
            <p>Now that I'm enrolled in university I've begun to see just how much there is to learn about Computer Science and I'm completely here for it.</p>

            <h3 class="box-header">Career</h3>
            <p>Since I've begun my journey in Computer Science, the fields that have stood out to me have been Web/App Development, Data Science, and Robotics.</p>
            <p>Before I came to UMKC, I worked as a IT technician for five years at the Republic School District in my hometown: Republic, MO. My duties ranged anywhere from replacing hardware to troubleshooting network systems across the district. Towards the end of my time there, I was given the role of working exclusively within the district's high school and being the sole technician for the whole building.</p>
            <p>I currently work for UMKC's Miller Nichols Library in the Circulation Department as a Student Monitor. I assist the circulation staff in the logistics of books and other content within the library. I also help in training new student workers and provide support to patrons who seek help at the front desk. My background as an IT technician has proven valuable as I often help patrons as well as my own coworkers with computer related issues.</p>

            <h3 class="box-header">Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>When I first came to UMKC, I began to look for clubs and activities to meet new people. I'm not originally from Kansas City, so I felt it was important to find friends so that I would not be discouraged from being lonely. I quickly found the UMKC Esports Club. I joined the School's Valorant Junior Varsity team and learned more than I ever would have guessed from my time on the team. I learned that I love doing things that involve teamwork. There's nothing quite like seeing your team overcome an adversity by working together like a well oiled machine.</p>
            <p>I am also a member of the university's Robotics and Computer Science Clubs. While robotics can be perceived as a more hardware focussed field of STEM, there are still plenty of opportunities to put the concepts that I've learned in my coursework into practice. These clubs also allow me to network with my classmates, and allow all of us to support eachother as courses become more advanced.</p>
            <p>Currently, I volunteer for a program under the local Catholic Charities called ReConnect. I am a mentor for a refugee youth and help him get acquainted to living in the United States whether that be through helping with English practice, tutoring in courses, or even just being there for him.</p>
